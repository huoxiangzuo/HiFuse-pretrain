## Overview
![paper1_1_01(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57312968/170870503-0b2c1728-daa8-4f80-a79b-d66c6748ac83.png)

## Run
0. Requirements:
* python3.6/3.7/3.8
* pytorch 1.10
* torchvision 0.11.1
1. Training:
* Prepare the required images and store them in categories, set up training image folders and validation image folders respectively
* Run `python train.py`
2. Resume training:
* Modify `parser.add_argument('--RESUME', type=bool, default=True)` in `python train.py`
* Run `python train.py`
3. Testing:
* Run `python test.py`

## TensorBoard
Run `tensorboard --logdir runs --port 6006` to view training progress
